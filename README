Given the exact solution to the parametrized circle: 

    dx/dt = -y
	dy/dt = x

Replace the RHS by a neural network that will approximate the time derivatives. To achieve this, a linear
network is sufficient. So one layer, and no activation function. 

I will create the exact solution over one period, and see if the neural network can extrapolate the solution. 
It probably can since the equations are linear.
